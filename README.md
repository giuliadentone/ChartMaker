# _ChartMaker
I developed this software by experimenting with Qt.

##Aim of the project
My main goal was to create a software that elaborates and manipolates data sets to generates different types of charts.

##How to run ChartMaker
To run the project first and foremost it's necessary to install Qt. You can find it [here](https://www.qt.io/download).
Then you can download the repository and navigate to the root of the project. After that all you need to do is thow those commands in your terminal:
- qmake -qt = qt5 
- make
- ./Chartmaker
This should show the main window on your screen.
